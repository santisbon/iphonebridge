# iphonebridge — Backlog

Park ideas here so they don't derail Phase 1.

## Phase 1 polish (after MVP works)
- [ ] Reconnect-on-suspend-resume logic (laptop sleep breaks BT session)
- [ ] Notification dismissal sync — when user dismisses libnotify popup, mark SMS read via MAP `Message1.Status = "read"`
- [ ] First-run pairing wizard (CLI) — guide user through iPhone-side toggles
- [ ] `iphonebridge sms list` — recent inbox dump
- [ ] `iphonebridge doctor` — check BlueZ, obexd, sessions, toggles
- [ ] Better contact resolution for international numbers (E.164 normalization)

## Phase 2 (revised after iMessage-over-MAP discovery 2026-05-19)

- [x] **MAP send / iMessage send** (`MessageAccess1.PushMessage`) — **CONFIRMED WORKING 2026-05-19 via spike/07_map_send.py**. iOS routes outgoing to iMessage-capable recipients as iMessage (blue bubble). iphonebridge is now read+send. NEXT: build a proper `iphonebridge sms-send <number> <body>` CLI command backed by a daemon DBus method (so we don't have to stop/restart the daemon to free the MAP session per send).
- [ ] **Graceful toggle-disabled handling** — when iPhone toggles are off, daemon currently crash-loops via systemd. Should log + back off + wait, not die.
- [ ] **First-run pair-setup wizard** — guide new users through CoD sudoers install + iPhone-side toggles.
- [ ] **Notification dismissal sync** — dismissing a libnotify popup → mark MAP `Message1.Status = "read"` on the iPhone.
- [ ] **`iphonebridge sms list` from MAP, not just JSONL** — pull recent inbox on demand via the live MAP session.
- [ ] **ANCS** for per-app notifications (Slack/WhatsApp/etc.) — deprioritized since iMessage already comes through. **Update 2026-05-20:** The fork [bmh129/ancs4linux](https://github.com/bmh129/ancs4linux) is actively developing fixes for the exact BR/EDR-vs-BLE coexistence issue our Phase 0 found. Key commit `0db80f3` fixes `_trigger_gatt_discovery` to probe ANCS UUIDs in the DBus tree instead of trusting `ServicesResolved`, plus uses `LastUsedBearer=le` to bias toward BLE reconnects. **No USB BT dongle needed** — bmh129 explicitly documents that no tested USB adapter works with ANCS on Linux (Realtek firmware uses P-192 keys, blocking CTKD). Our Intel-chipset adapter is the recommended hardware. Phase 2a path: vendor or port their fix into iphonebridge.
- [x] **HFP HF role** — **DONE 2026-05-20.** Take *and* place iPhone calls on
  the laptop via oFono (`org.ofono`) for call control + PipeWire's oFono HFP
  backend for SCO audio. Caller ID, answer/decline, dialing, all confirmed
  (spike `05b_hfp_ofono.py`, `spike/RESULTS.md` HFP addendum). CLI: `call`,
  `hangup`, `calls`, `hfp-enable`.
- [x] **GTK4 / libadwaita app** — **DONE 2026-05-20.** Standalone `iphonebridge-ui`
  (separate process, talks to the daemon over D-Bus): conversations, ANCS
  notification feed, call UI, and a setup/status page. Daemon gained an
  `Events1` D-Bus signal interface for the UI to subscribe to.

## Phase 3 / nice-to-have
- [ ] Encrypted SQLite for message cache
- [ ] Multi-device support (currently hard-coded to one iPhone MAC)
- [ ] Single `.deb` packaging daemon + CLI + UI (instructions:
  `packaging/deb/README.md`). Kills the venv dance
  (depends on distro python3-dbus/python3-gi) and the @INSTALL_DIR@
  placeholder (fixed paths under /usr). Ships the sudoers rule, user unit
  (/usr/lib/systemd/user/), desktop entry, and icon.
  - Design decision: the sudoers rule grants a specific username today;
    a system package serves all users, so it becomes group-based
    (NOPASSWD on the one btmgmt command for an `iphonebridge` group,
    postinst-created; users add themselves).
  - Debian-family only at first; rpm later if wanted. Auto-updates
    need a PPA or small apt repo eventually.
- [ ] iOS version regression test matrix
- [ ] DBus service `me.santisbon.iphonebridge` so other UIs can subscribe to events

## Won't do
- ~~iMessage send/read~~ — *update 2026-05-19: iMessage *read* works via MAP on iOS 26.5! Send TBD.*
- Per-app reply (ANCS is read-only, no protocol path)
- Group iMessage / MMS / RCS (1:1 only)
- ~~Outgoing calls from laptop~~ — *update 2026-05-20: WRONG. HFP HF `Dial`
  rings the target reliably (3/3 in spike 05b). Outgoing calls now ship.*
- Read receipts, typing indicators, message reactions, full attachments
